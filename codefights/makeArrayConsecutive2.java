/*
 * Ratiorg got statues of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday, 
 * each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect, 
 * he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than 
 * the previous one exactly by 1. He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. 
 * Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed.
 * 
 * Example
 * For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be
 * makeArrayConsecutive2(statues) = 3.
 * 
 * Ratiorg needs statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7.
 * 
 * Input/Output
 * [time limit] 3000ms (java)
 * [input] array.integer statues
 * 
 * An array of distinct non-negative integers.
 * 
 * Guaranteed constraints:
 * 1 ¡Â statues.length ¡Â 10,
 * 0 ¡Â statues[i] ¡Â 20.
 * 
 * [output] integer
 * The minimal number of statues that need to be added to existing statues such that it contains 
 * every integer size from an interval [L, R] (for some L, R) and no other sizes.
